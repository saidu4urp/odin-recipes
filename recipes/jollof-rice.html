    <h2>Party Jollof Rice Recipe</h2>
    <p> Celebration in an African home CAN NOT happen without the presence of Jollof rice.</p>
    <p>Jollof rice is a very common dish prepared in many African countries and each recipe differs depending on the
        nation.
        I specifically prepare the Nigerian party jollof rice which I still feel is one of the best recipes out there
    </p>
    <p>Party jollof rice is commonly the most sort after type of rice, because of its very unique taste. Most people
        feel the unique taste comes from preparation using firewood,
        but that isnâ€™t always necessarily the case.</p>
